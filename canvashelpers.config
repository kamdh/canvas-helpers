#     The quizzes created by the WebPA script can be edited if required by changing the default content below.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Customise the WebPA quiz title and description below. Note that [group name] will be appended to the title value for
# later use when processing responses. The title must be plain text, but the description can use basic HTML.
webpa_quiz_title = Peer contribution assessment
webpa_quiz_description = <p>For each rating question, please choose a number from 1–5:</p>
                         <ol>
                         <li>Made only a small contribution, or contributed work of a poor standard</li>
                         <li><i>(between 1 and 3)</i></li>
                         <li>Made an average contribution</li>
                         <li><i>(between 3 and 5)</i></li>
                         <li>Contributed to the most challenging aspects of the work at a high standard</li>
                         </ol>
                         <p>Enter a rating for <u>every</u> group member, <u>including yourself</u>.</p>
                         <p>If a group member is entirely unresponsive, report this separately (and rate them as 1 in
                         this exercise).</p>

# --- WebPA setup when using traditional Canvas quizzes ---
# Use this value to customise the rating WebPA quiz questions. The `webpa_rating_question_description` value *must*
# contain the string `{group member}` to allow individual group members' details to be inserted. If needed, it can also
# use basic HTML. (Note: we don't currently use quiz question titles as Canvas doesn't seem to actually display them.)
webpa_rating_question_description = <p>Enter a contribution rating for {group member}. Your response must be a number –
                                    either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Ratings that are not integers within the range 1–5 will be
                                    rounded to the nearest valid value or discarded.</p>
# --- WebPA setup when using traditional Canvas quizzes ---

# --- WebPA setup when using "New" Canvas quizzes ---
# "New" quizzes support multiple choice questions, so each response option can be customised individually. The
# `webpa_rating_question_body` value *must* contain the string `{group member}` to allow individual group members'
# details to be inserted. All values can use basic HTML.
webpa_rating_question_body = <p>Enter a contribution rating for {group member}.</p>
webpa_rating_question_choice_1 = <p><b>1</b>: Made only a small contribution, or contributed work of a poor standard</p>
webpa_rating_question_choice_2 = <p><b>2</b>: <i>(between 1 and 3)</i></p>
webpa_rating_question_choice_3 = <p><b>3</b>: Made an average contribution</p>
webpa_rating_question_choice_4 = <p><b>4</b>: <i>(between 3 and 5)</i></p>
webpa_rating_question_choice_5 = <p><b>5</b>: Contributed to the most challenging aspects of the work at a high standard</p>
# --- WebPA setup when using "New" Canvas quizzes ---


# Customise the post-rating general comments WebPA question below. The value can use basic HTML. (Note: we don't
# currently use quiz question titles as Canvas doesn't seem to actually display them.)
webpa_comment_question_description = <p><u>Optional</u>: enter any additional comments about group member contribution.
                                     You can enter "None" or leave blank to skip.</p>

#     Most helper tools require only the standard Canvas API token above, but in some cases additional details are
#     required as outlined below. These fields can be ignored if you don't use the helper tools that require them.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Scripts that interact with results from Canvas New Quizzes require an access token because the Canvas API still does
# not support programmatic or bulk access to quiz results(!). There are two ways to get this value:
# 1) Open your browser's console in the quiz assignment's SpeedGrader view and enter:
#        open(window.speedgrader_iframe.src)
#    Note: you may need to allow popups for your institution's Canvas pages for this to work. In the window that opens,
#    open the browser's console again, and enter:
#        window.sessionStorage.access_token
#    The returned value (without quotes) is the token you need.
#
# - or -
#
# 2) Visit the quiz assignment in question and then open your browser's Developer Tools. In the Network tab, look at the
#    Request Headers for one of the initial requests (such as 'info') and copy the token from the 'authorization' row.
#
# NOTE: this token is short-lived, so needs to be re-entered periodically - just follow either of the steps above again.
